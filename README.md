Android code for draw in real time graphs

Android code example showing how to draw one or two graphs in Real time.

I simulate the "real time" by using a thread who sleep each 100ms
The graph is drawn from left to right from the bottom left corner.
In the case of a graphic mutli, the drawings of the 2 graphics adapt automatically according to the Y that you sent so that the 2 graphics keep the same scale

For example if the Y of your graph 2 is higher than that of your graph, the drawing of graph 1 will apply a little in order to adapt to the new scale
